## Project Overview

AlchemyHub facilitates a skill-bartering system where users "pay" with services rather than money. Users create profiles, showcase their skills, earn "Skill Credits" for services provided, and use these credits to request services from others. With optional blockchain integration, AlchemyHub aims to provide a decentralized and transparent marketplace for skills.
